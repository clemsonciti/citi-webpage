This workshop focuses on data mining techniques in R, with the emphasis on techniques to acquiring and 
curating data via online sources. For acquiring data, we will learn how to download from static links, 
crawl through entire websites, and stream data from real-time sources. For curating data, we will 
learn how to expand and extract information from acquired data, which are often stored under 
non-structured/semi-structured online data (XML, JSON, ...), into structured format suitable to 
subsequent analysis. We will also learn about best practices in data management, including organizing 
data directories, working with databases, and automating data-mining process through the Palmetto Supercomputer.
