**DETAILS:**

The OU Supercomputing Center for Education & Research (OSCER) is
hosting a webinar on managing research data with [Globus](https://www.globus.org/).

[Globus](https://www.globus.org/) is software-as-a-service for research data management and
provides high speed, secure file transfer; file sharing
directly from existing stage systems; and data publication to
institutional repositories.

Developed and operated by the University of Chicago, [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) has
become a preferred service for moving and sharing data between and
among a wide variety of storage systems at research labs, campus
computing resources, and national facilities across the US.

In this session, you will learn about the features of the [Globus](https://www.globus.org/)
service, and how to use it to streamline your research data flows.

The webinar will help you answer these questions:

* How can [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) help me overcome the challenges I face in moving
increasingly "big" datasets?
* How can I share data with collaborators at other institutions
more efficiently?
* How can I use [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) to more easily leverage large-scale
computing resources, both on campus and beyond?

The presentation is aimed at those new to [Globus](https://www.globus.org/), but attendees
with prior [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) experience may also benefit by learning about
new and planned features.

This webinar will be made available live via BlueJeans
videoconferencing.

Registrants will be sent connection information in advance.

Organizers:

* Steve Tuecke, Globus/U Chicago
* Vas Vasiliadis, Globus/U Chicago
