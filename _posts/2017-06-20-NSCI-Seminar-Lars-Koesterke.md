**Abstract**   
The only constant in HPC (High Performance Computing) seems to be the constant change in hardware. In recent years the increasing demand for compute power and energy efficiency has favored heterogeneous computing in which accelerator cards are added to compute nodes. GPUs have become popular in a number of communities and Intel introduced their first accelerator (Knights Corner, KNC) in 2013. However, with Intel’s second generation (Knights Landing, KNL) of the Many Integrated Cores (MIC) architecture (introduced in late 2016) we see a comeback of homogeneous computing. In my talk I will present the KNL architecture and will discuss its numerous advantages over the first generation of MICs. Early experiences with the KNL’s have been very positive and many in the community see a path forward for large-scale homogenous clusters. I will share general impressions and personal experiences with the new architecture, and will attempt to outline the changes in application codes necessary to take advantage of current and upcoming homogeneous hardware.
