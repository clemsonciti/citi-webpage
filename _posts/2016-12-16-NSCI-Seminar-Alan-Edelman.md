**Presenters:** Prof Alan Edelman (CSAIL and Dept of Mathematics, MIT) and Keno Fischer (Co-Founder and CTO, Julia Computing)  
**Time:** 1:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m.  
**Place:** Watts Family Innovation Center Auditorium (streamed from NIST)  
**Date:** Friday, 12/16/2016   

**Abstract**  
Julia offers a fresh approach to technical computing.  It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive function library.  Announced barely a year ago, Julia has evolved into a significant open source project with over 500 contributors to the core, and 1200 community contributed packages.  Performance,  ease of use for exploration and deployment, scalability, applicability to “big data” problems, and collaboration in the open online community are some of the key draws for various communities of scientists, engineers, and business users.

Julia is ripe for adoption in a world, where safety is of paramount importance. The FAA is already using Julia as a specification language for avionics systems - starting with the Advanced Collision Avoidance System (ACAS-X) to be notified in the next couple of years. The NY Fed is using Julia for large scale simulations, and autonomous vehicles doing their path planning in Julia have been showcased to the NHTSA.
