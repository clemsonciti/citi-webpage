**Abstract**   
This presentation will provide an overview of the NSF-funded XSEDE  (Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment) project. XSEDE provides advanced research computing and data resources and services to the national community supporting open research funded by universities as well as federal agencies and other sources.  We will discuss the resources, services and support available to the research community. These resources are also available to NIST researchers and a few recent examples will be highlighted.  Finally, we will  also look at how XSEDE, as an exemplar research infrastructure, can support the objectives of the NSCI with a focus on the roles the NSF is tasked with.
