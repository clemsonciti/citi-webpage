**Abstract**  
Virtually every scientific discipline has been impacted by the revolution of the digital age. Modeling and simulation and the extraction of useful information from increasingly large data sets have become the sine qua non for progress in science and engineering (S&E).  Taking a broad view, it is obvious that without computation fields such as cosmology, general relativity, materials science (MD,MGI), nuclear, plasma, condensed matter and high energy physics (QCD) would be severely and negatively impacted.  Other fields, such as atomic and molecular physics rely on computation to produce accurate atomic data on fundamental atomic and molecular properties as well as collision and photonic cross sections required for many practical applications. This is not only important in catalyzing new discovery but also for technological advancement. In addition, the size of the data sets that aerated being generated from instruments such as telescopes, particle accelerators and sensors are becoming so large thatit is impossible to extract any really meaningful results  without large-scale computation and data analysis.  I use the term cyberscience to denote this new approach to discovery in S&E.  However, it is also the case that without accompanying developments in cyberinfrastucture ( hardware, software, networking ) this revolution would not have been possible.  
In this talk I will provide an overview of some of the interesting  developments that have been happening in CS and CI over the past few decades and speculate a bit on where things might be headed in the next decade as we face the challenges of Mooresâ€™s law beginning to fail.
