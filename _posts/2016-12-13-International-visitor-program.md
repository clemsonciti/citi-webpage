CITI is hosting an international visiting scholar program. Three graduate students from [Xi’an University of Technology](http://old.xaut.edu.cn/english/) arrived last week and they are going to stay in Clemson for 3 months. They are working with professors of Clemson, while get trained and managed by CITI. They have already participated in CITI workshops, GENI networking workshops and started their research projects. 

The idea of the visiting scholar program is to focus on a research/project experience and to provide study aboard opportunities. We are planning to have this potentially be a continuing program with more students from more majors. If you are interested in having one student in your department, or you have interesting projects and would like graduate students to join, please email Dr. Nuyun (Nellie) Zhang at <nuyun@clemson.edu>. 

For any questions or further information, please feel free to contact to Dr. Nuyun (Nellie) Zhang <nuyun@clemson.edu>.
