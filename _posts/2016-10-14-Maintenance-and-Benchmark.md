Please save the date for the next biannual Palmetto outage and
benchmark which is scheduled to begin **Friday, October 14th 2016**.

The whole Palmetto cluster will be unavailable starting 8:00am Friday,
October 14th. Phases 1-6 and 8c will be put back in service
as soon as the maintenance is complete (Monday, October 17th or
earlier).

Remaining phases will stay offline for benchmark and will be put
back in service after the benchmark is completed. We estimate all 
IB phases back online **Tuesday, October 25th**.

Please schedule important compute jobs to finish before Friday,
October 14th to make sure the outage will affect your work as little
as possible.
